# bootstrapportfolio
My personal portfolio made using Bootstrap layouts

My Portfolio came together through the use of Bootstrap components, such as cards and the navbar. Unfortunately, you cannot just copy and paste a bunch of components on your pages and expect it to look good. 
This is where the Bootstrap grid method comes in. The grid method helps you to map out designated areas for your components so that they all fit on the page seamlessly.
By including the "viewport" component I was able to make my website responsive to different sized screens.
